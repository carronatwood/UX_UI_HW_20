            <p class="lead">This project sought out an opportunity to bring hair care products and knowledge to users
                who needed help understanding and caring for their hair. We wanted to remain accessible to all, but with
                a strong focus on textured hair. We identified the pain points of users through interviews and survey
                data and found that the mains struggles related to an abundance of misinformation and general lack of
                access to reliable information, along with this we found that people were finding it hard to access
                products in stores that would work well for their hair. To combat these issues, Hair Goals was born. We
                created the prototype for an app that would allow users to take a hair quiz to find out exactly what
                type and porosity they have, then make recommendations and provide a library of resources where they can
                do further reading about how to care for their unique type of hair, and an element of connection with
                other uses through messaging and the ability to write and like other posts. Along with this, we wanted
                to provide an optional subscription service that caters products directly to their individual needs and
                as a way to monetize the service while remaining accessible.

                    solve these with our app - we wanted our focus to be information, access to the right products and a

                <p>Our initial lo-fi sketched out wireframes were our first attempt to see how we wanted to address

                    Profile, Library, Inspo, Shop, Messages. Through rounds of testing and iterations we found the most
                    intutive and user friendly way to organize our screens and finally added high fidelity design and
                    branding to create a beaultif and useful product to meet user needs

                    to further develop the social aspect for a more connected experience and find a way to "game-ify"
                    with incentives and competitions in future iterations
